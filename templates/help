    I have sent some sample commands in your alexa app.
    <break time="200ms"/>
    To begin, you can say
    <break time="100ms"/>
    Check {{agency}} for {{route}} at stop
    <say-as interpret-as="digits">{{stop}}</say-as>.
    <break time="250ms"/>
    For even more commands, check the alexa app for the {{city}}Transit skill page.
